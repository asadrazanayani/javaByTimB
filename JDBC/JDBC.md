## JDBC 
- All JDBC drivers have to implement the same interfaces, it is not difficult to change the data source an application uses. 
- For example, we can change the mySQL from SQLite
- We can use JDBC to work with a spreadsheet or a flat file as long as there's a JDBC driver.
- We have to write JDBC driver ourselves, if necessary.
