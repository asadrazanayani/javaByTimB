##Encapsulation
What? Restrict direct access to certain components of the objects. Protect the members of the class from external sources
Why? because it helps us maintain the integrity of the Object. (validate parameters for example)
    Also helps with refactoring, for example if we want to change certain member variable names,
    we can do that without having to correct the variable name in the part where we used the class,
    unless the getters and setters method signature has also changed
How? Use Access modifiers like private to restrict direct access to member variables.
