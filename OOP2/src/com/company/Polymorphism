##Polymorphism
What? Means many forms, The mechanism in OOP that allows actions to act differently based on the actual object.
It mainly refers to overriding and overloading. Emphases on overriding because it is runtime.
How? If the inherited parent class has a method, the child class can override that method to make sure the implementation is specific to the child.
Why? Combining with abstraction and inheritance, polymorphism allows us to write generic codes if the parent class is abstract, or has a abstract method.
It will force the derived class or the child class to implement specific implementation of the abstract class.

Note: Movie example is a good example to showcase polymorphism.
