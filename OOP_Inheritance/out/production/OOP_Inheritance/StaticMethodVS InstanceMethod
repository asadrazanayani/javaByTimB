##Static Method
in Static method, we cannot use this keyword
If a method does not use instance variable than that method should probably be static
For example, main is the static method called by JVM when it starts an application.
Static method can be called directly from the class

##Instance Method
To use instance method of a class, we must instantiate a class by using the new keyword.
Instance method can access both static methods and instance method
