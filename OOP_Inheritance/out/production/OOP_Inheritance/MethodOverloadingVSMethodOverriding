##Overloading
    Java developers like to refer overloading as compile time polymorphism
    It is called compile time because the compiler decides which method is going to be called.

##Overloading rules
    methods must have same name
    methods must have different parameters.

##Method overriding
Only inherited can be overriden
Cannot override constructor, final, and private members.
