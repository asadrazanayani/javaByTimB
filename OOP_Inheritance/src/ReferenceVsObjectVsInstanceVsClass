## Reference
Reference is the location in memory of the object we create. Each object we create is called a reference.
In java, we cannot access the object directly. Everything is done via a reference.

If we change the object, all the references will also be changed if the references are pointing to that object

## New keyword
Everytime we use new keyword, we will create a new object (instances of the class)

## Assignment operator
We use assignment operator to refer an object to a variable.
